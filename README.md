### How I Use GitHub

Beyond my software projects, I also use GitHub to manage academic papers (e.g., in mathematics) alongside their related code.

The key benefit is keeping simulation code, datasets, Jupyter Notebooks, and the paper itself (PDF or LaTeX source) all in one place, perfectly version-controlled.
